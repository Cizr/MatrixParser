# Matrix Parser with PLY

This Python project implements a matrix parser using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). The parser is designed to recognize and process matrices written in a specific syntax. It provides a simple way to define and parse matrices with the flexibility of PLY.

## Usage

The parser allows users to input matrix expressions and validates their syntax. It can be used as a foundation for more advanced matrix-related applications or as a learning tool for working with PLY in Python.

## How it Works

The parser follows a set of defined grammar rules to recognize matrix structures. It leverages the PLY library for lexing and parsing, providing a robust and extensible framework for syntax analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cizr/MatrixParser.git
